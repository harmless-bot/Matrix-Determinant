# Matrix Determinant Calculator  

this is one of my beginner projects in Python. 


It is a simple program that calculates the determinant of a 3×3 matrix
I plan to add more features in the future.  

---

# Features = 
- accepts manual input of a 3×3 matrix  
  - (!note: input must be integers. The program exits if floats are entered, or if the wrong number of elements are given. spaces are required between elements.)  
- displays the matrix in a clean, formatted style  
- calculates the determinant using minors and cofactors

---
numpy library is used

## Updates  =
v1.1  
- supports only 3×3 matrix determinant calculation
