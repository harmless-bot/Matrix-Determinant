# Matrix Determinant Calculator  

this is one of my beginner projects in Python. 


It is a simple program that calculates the determinant of a 3×3 matrix. Just copy the code and run it :}
I plan to add more features in the future.  

---

# Features = 
-> accepts manual input of a 3×3 matrix  
  **(!note: input must be integers. The program exits if floats are entered, or if the wrong number of elements are given. spaces are required between elements.)  
-> displays the matrix in a clean, formatted style  
-> calculates the determinant using minors and cofactors
-- Checks **matrix properties**:
  - Symmetric
  - Skew-Symmetric
  - Upper Triangular
  - Lower Triangular
  - Null Matrix
  - Identity Matrix
   (numpy library is used)   

-------------------------
Updates-------->
-------------------------
v1.1  
->supports only 3×3 matrix determinant calculation  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2
->Added **interactive loop** to allow checking multiple matrices without restarting the program  
->Explicit element assignments (`a` through `i`) for clarity 
->Added **matrix property checks**: Symmetric, Skew-Symmetric, Upper/Lower Triangular, Null, and Identity
